# Secrets of a JavaScript Ninja Notes

## Table Of Contents


## Description 

These are my personal notes for the book ['Secrets of a JavaScript Ninja (2nd edition). I highly recommend you click this link and buy a copy](https://www.manning.com/books/secrets-of-the-javascript-ninja-second-edition). I have enjoyed it so far. I do not get any kickback for you buying the book. I am just citing my source and it's the right thing to do.

Since these are my personal notes, I have changed the names of variables, function parameter/argument names to another theme. Chapter 3 has a Muppet theme. The function logic will stay the same. I just wanted to reinforce concepts and not just copy and paste examples.
